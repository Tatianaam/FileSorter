Filer Sorter CLI app

Created as an exercise to practice TDD, refresh basics of working with files in java and to help clean up some mess ;)

There is a folder with bunch of leases agreements, all of them have addresses, some may have words: lease agreement, signed, commercial lease, some at the begining  of name, sme at the end.
A lot of times some leases were copied over and years 2021, 2022.. were added.

Goal is to organize the folder a bit and create folders for each address.

Runs with " java -jar FileSorter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"
